Aim:
To implement Simple Linear Regression and plot the regression line for a given dataset.

---

Algorithm:
1. Prepare sample input (X) and output (y) data.
2. Fit a Linear Regression model.
3. Predict the output values.
4. Plot original data points and the regression line.

---

Program:

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

X = [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]]
y = [2,4,5,4,5]
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, model.predict(X), 'r')
plt.show()

---

Output:
A graph window showing:
Blue dots = original data
Red line = regression line

---

Result:
Simple Linear Regression was successfully implemented. The regression line was plotted based on the sample dataset.
